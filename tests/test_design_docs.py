"""Design-doc upkeep — the contract file owns the path -> design-doc ownership map.

The map lives in a fenced ```design-doc-map block in AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md when a
repo has only that one) so agents read the same SSOT this tooling parses; there is no
second copy to drift.

pytest asserts the map is STRUCTURAL (every doc it names exists, every package is
mapped or explicitly `none`, and the two contract files stay identical when a repo
keeps both). Drift is REPORTED, never asserted:

    python3 <path/to>/test_design_docs.py

prints, per doc, the modules added or removed under its owned paths since that doc
last changed. A merge gate on doc freshness buys rubber-stamp edits, not maintained
docs, so this stays a report. Added/removed modules are the signal; commit counts are
context only.

This file is shared verbatim across repos — it locates its own repo root, so it works
at any depth. Do not fork it per repo.

Canonical home: ~/dotfiles/design-doc-contract/test_design_docs.py — patch there, then
propagate with ~/dotfiles/local-bin/design-doc-checker-sync.
